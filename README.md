# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

# Tailwindcss

Tailwind CSS is an open source CSS framework developed by Tailwind Labs. The main feature of this library is that, unlike other CSS
frameworks such as Bootstrap, it does not provide a number of predefined classes for elements such as buttons or tables.
